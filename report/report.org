* Introduction
I've been interested in the world of ray marching for a while, in
particular the fantastic work of Inigo Quilez[fn:6]. His blog explains
an enormous amount of techniques to create unbelievable procedural
scenes. Most of these shaders are hosted at Shadertoy.com, which is an
online tool for sharing shaders with WebGL. Code from other shaders I
have been inspired by are all credited in comments in the source code.
\\\\
My primary goal for this project thus became to create interesting
fragment shaders, primarily using ~gl_FragCoord~.  For this report I
will go through the process step by step, from the baby steps required
to render a simple sphere, to the final leaps that render a realistic
looking scene. Limitations of the techniques, as well as problems
encountered will be pointed out along the way.

* Building the project
The project uses CMake (Gloom) for the building process, as is
required for the assignment. I've also taken the liberty of adding
three libraries to use sound: OpenAL Soft, freealut and FFTW. OpenAL
and freealut are added as submodules with Git, while FFTW is added as
an external project in CMake. I suggest pulling the repository from
GitHub[fn:5], as this has been tested to work cleanly from scratch.

* Ray Marching
Now -- what is this ray marching thing? In the world of /ray casting/,
it is common to be familiar with /ray tracing/ to compute the
intersections of a light ray with surfaces. /Ray marching/ may be used
within such a ray tracing method, as it is a specific algorithm for
this purpose. Using ray marching in combination with something that's
called /signed distance functions/ can make extraordinary scenes from
infinitesimal binary executables, as all that's required are the
underlying mathematical formulas.
\\\\
A signed distance function, let's say a sphere centered at the origin,
$f(x, y, z) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} - 1$, can be used to determine
whether a point is inside or outside an object, as well as the
distance to the object if it is outside. This is in contrast to more
well known ray tracing implementations that have to check for
intersections with quite a lot of primitives.
\\\\
So how does this work in practice? In ~simple.frag~, there is a
function, ~sd_sphere~, that takes a point and a radius as arguments,
and returns the distance to the sphere's perimeter. This is becoming
interesting: below are two illustrations I have found to explain the
further steps the best.

The left[fn:1] image shows how rays are traced from a camera. The
right[fn:2] image illustrates how the iterative steps are taken by the
ray marching algorithm according to the distance to the object closest
to the current point.

* Humble beginnings
<<sec:beginnings>>
Let's put our new knowledge to a test -- the execution of the ray
marching algorithm is found in any of the ~trace_<object>~
functions. A simple rendering of a sphere with some phong shading is
shown in [[fig:simplesphere][this image]]. Spheres are just the beginning; we have SDFs for
a wide range of shapes[fn:7].

* Setting the stage
<<sec:creatingascene>>
So we have a method of rendering a single sphere. How do we go about
turning this into a complex scene? The first trick we will pull out of
our sleeve is intersections and unions. If we compute the distance to
more than one object, and then do ~max~ (intersect) or ~min~ (union)
between them, we can have multiple objects in our scene. The technique
can be seen in action [[fig:union][here]]. A problem I encountered at this stage was
using GLSL effictively. I practically gave up on optimization, but
most of all I was missing the ability to pass around function pointers
for distance functions (which could perhaps be done with ~switch~
statements anyway, as I'm already murdering the performance with
conditionals).

* Shadows
<<sec:shadows>> An advantage of signed distance functions is that they
provide us with global information. Given a point on a surface in a
scene, we can fairly easily explore our surroundings -- we just have
to recalculate the SDF with new points. For shadowing, we simply
follow what's called a /shadow ray/ from the surface point towards the
position of a given light. If it intersects some other object on the
way, the light will not contribute to the illumination. We can also
put areas that are /almost/ within the shadow under penumbra by
checking how close we are to intersecting objects on the
way. [[fig:penumbra][Illustration]]. This perhaps the most pressing advantage of ray
tracing in general: effects such as shadows and reflections are
natural results of the algorithm.

* Ambient occlusion
<<sec:ao>>
So the shadowing in the previous section looks quite good, but the
ambient lighting looks a little flat. We can get fake, fast ambient
occlusion in a fairly simple manner: evaluate the distance function at
a few points around the actual point we are shading. By comparing the
results of the scene SDF at these points to the original point, we
gain information about the proximity of other surfaces around us, and
with this information we can make an educated guess on the occlusion
of the surface we are [[fig:ao][shading]]. A limitation of this method is that
it's a crude approximation, and may give results that seem /off/
(e.g. floor occluding /a lot/ of the light hitting the bottom of a
wall).

* Reflection and refraction
<<sec:water>>
Planes can easily be represented as SDFs with a single height value,
and wave-like displacements can be added with a simple sine, as can be
seen [[fig:simplewater][here]]. Adding reflection is no harder than adding shadows -- we
simply march again from points of intersection in a reflected
direction, and mix the reflection color with the reflective surface
color ([[fig:reflection][example]]). We also add a fresnel effect such that steeper angles
give weaker reflections. At this point I started noticing how
optimizing ray marching could give numerical [[fig:instability][instability]], especially
when estimating the normals of a [[fig:instability2][sinc wave]] for lighting purposes. This
is a weakness with ray marching, as we have to estimate the normal, as
opposed to it being passed into the rendering pipeline.
\\\\
Another important effect to add when working with water is
refraction. Water is transparent, so we should be able to see the
sphere when it's underwater. Refraction is similar to reflection in
that we do another ray march, but this time we first bend the ray
according to the refractive index of water, giving [[fig:refraction][this]] effect.

* Realistic waves
<<sec:realisticwaves>>
So we might be tempted to say that the effects above make a pretty
cool shader, but we can do much better: time for a noise texture and
fractal Brownian motion. Explanations of these methods are slightly
too complicated to fit into four pages, but the implementation
contains comments on the workings, as well as links to further
readings. The [[fig:noise][effect]] of adding this noise is moving water that
looks to be flowing in the pseudorandom motion water does in reality.

* Realistically colored realistic waves
<<sec:realisticcolor>>
Our waves still look like plastic, much due to a weakness with the
specular shading from the phong lighting, and the fact that the water
still has intrinsic color. Now, let's set the default color of water
to to resemble the darkness below, and make sure we only color the
water by the color of the reflected sky. If we also lay a sheet of
rain on the screen according to the noise texture, as well as
spreading some splashes on the water surface in a random manner. We
are starting to get something that looks like [[fig:okwater][real water]]. At this
point I was starting to notice one of the major disadvantages of ray
marching: the performance. Rendering on my laptop, which has an
integrated graphics card, required me to lower the resolution to
512x256.

* Further incremental improvements
<<sec:furtherimprovements>>
Now we add some clouds to the sky, by simply sampling our noise
texture again, such that we can see the horizon in the distance. Then
we add some lightning so the scene lights up at random intervals. Then
we make the sphere into something that looks like a planet with lava
by sampling another texture suited for this purpose (however, it is
still procedurally generated). [[fig:improvements][We're getting somewhere]].

* Sound and a Fast Fourier Transform
<<sec:sound>>
The CPU is mostly idling between the rendering of frames, but we can
do something about this. Usage of a Fast Fourier Transform is very
common in shaders. For this project I used FFTW to do an STFT over a
.wav file of music (stolen from YouTube[fn:3]), and set the sphere in the
scene to visualize the lower frequencies of the song (< 30Hz). This
creates an effect of the sphere expanding on the onset of bass notes,
especially the kick drum. When expanding the sphere we also see a
problem with wrapping a square texture around a sphere -- the poles
stretch a lot.

* A finishing touch
<<sec:periscope>>
To finish the scene, I decided to combine some SDFs to create a
periscope that would float across the scene. This is done by combining
two cylinders with an elongated torus to create the pipes and
window. They are combined with a smooth union. The pipes are made
reflective, which looks fairly good, but a more matte, rusty surface
might make it look less out of place. By doing this modelling by hand
with SDFs, I got to feel how cumbersome the process is. There is a
reason we have modelling tools, but I still have an immense amount of
respect for the demo sceners that create these models
procedurally. The final scene can be seen in [[fig:finalscene][this]] screenshot, or in a
video that I've uploaded to YouTube[fn:4]. The periscope is visible
from about 8 seconds into the video. YouTube really did a number on
the quality, so the full quality version is available[fn:8]
(recommended version -- try with VLC or Chrome, the new Firefox
wouldn't play the file).
